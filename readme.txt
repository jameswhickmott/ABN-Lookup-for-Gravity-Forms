== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I configure the plugin?**

A range of options can be found under the Gravity Forms 'ABN Lookup' settings menu.

**How do I change the value attribute of the GST result field**

Two filters are available for customising the 'value' attribute for the GST result field:

itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_yes

itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_no

Example usage:

Please note: there appears to be an issue with returning a '0' value - so in this case return '00'.

`add_filter( 'itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_yes', 'my_itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_yes', 10, 2 );

function my_itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_yes( $text_yes, $form_id ) {
	return '10';
}

add_filter( 'itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_no', 'my_itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_no', 10, 2 );

function my_itsg_gf_abnlookup_gst_value_no( $text_no, $form_id ) {
	return '00';
}`
